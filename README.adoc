== Structure

`sources/`::
source of documents

`site/`::

== Building the document

If you have installed the build tools locally, and wish to run the
locally-installed compilation tools, there is nothing further to set.

If you use a locally installed Metanorma, run:

[source,sh]
----
metanorma site generate
----

If you don't want to deal with local dependencies, use the docker
version by:

[source,sh]
----
docker run -v "$(pwd)":/metanorma -w /metanorma -it metanorma/mn metanorma site generate
----
